# Nearest-Neighbor-Search-NNS-Finding-the-Closest-Data-Points-in-Feature-Space
A survey exploring Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) methods for similarity retrieval. It compares exact approaches (brute-force, spatial trees) with approximate techniques (LSH, graph-based HNSW), detailing their trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and scalability, especially under the curse of dimensionality.
